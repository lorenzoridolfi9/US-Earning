# US Earning

### This repository contains the dataset, R code, and final report of a predictive analysis of the value of corporate earnings, starting from a historical series and implementing the ARIMA algorithm.

### Dataset :bar_chart:
The dataset is a time series on the profits generated by U.S. listed companies, on a quarterly basis, from 1950 to the third quarter of 2021.

### Analysis Process :chart_with_upwards_trend:
The paper is divided into the following parts:
1. preliminary exploratory analysis
2. ADF-test and seasonality of the time series
3. ARIMA algorithm. 

Once the most appropriate model was identified, the values were predicted over a time interval of two and three years.

Forecasts are available in the final report with accompanying graphs.
